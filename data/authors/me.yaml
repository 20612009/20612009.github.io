role: Environmental (Bio)geochemist

bio: |
  I am an M.S. Research student in Civil Engineering (Environmental Engineering specialization) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India. My training is interdisciplinary, integrating hydrogeology, (bio)geochemistry, stable isotopes, and environmental process modeling to investigate water quality dynamics under anthropogenic stress. I have contributed to peer-reviewed research articles and conference presentations. 
  
  I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities where I can integrate field investigations, laboratory experimentation, and quantitative modeling to address complex environmental challenges. My prospective research areas for PhD include biogeochemistry of aquatic systems, fate and transport of inorganic and organic contaminants, wastewater treatment and management, emerging contaminants such as PFAS (“forever chemicals”), reactive transport processes, and CO₂ sequestration through carbon–mineral interactions.

    summary: |
      MS(R) thesis investigates the biogeochemical and hydrological controls on arsenic mobilization and speciation in mixed oxic alluvial aquifers. By integrating groundwater hydrochemistry, stable isotope analysis, hydraulic gradient evaluation, and mineral–colloid characterization, the study examines anthropogenic influences and secondary precipitation processes regulating arsenic fate and transport.
