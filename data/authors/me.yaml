bio: |
  Mohd Musahib is an environmental biogeochemistry researcher and M.S. candidate in Environmental Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. His work focuses on water quality processes in groundwater and surface water systems under anthropogenic stress. He investigates contaminant fate and transport, redox-driven geochemical transformations, and sediment–water interactions using integrated field surveys, laboratory analyses, and quantitative modeling. His broader interests include reactive transport modeling and catchment-scale biogeochemical dynamics relevant to sustainable water resource management.
