bio: |
  Mohd Musahib is an environmental biogeochemistry researcher and M.S. candidate in Environmental Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. His work focuses on water quality processes in groundwater and surface water systems under anthropogenic stress. He investigates contaminant fate and transport, redox-driven geochemical transformations, and sediment–water interactions using integrated field surveys, laboratory analyses, and quantitative modeling. His broader interests include reactive transport modeling and catchment-scale biogeochemical dynamics relevant to sustainable water resource management.

    summary: |
  
   MS(R) thesis investigates the biogeochemical and hydrological controls on arsenic mobilization and speciation in mixed oxic alluvial aquifers. By integrating groundwater hydrochemistry, stable isotope analysis, hydraulic gradient evaluation, and mineral–colloid characterization, the study examines the role of anthropogenic influences plus secondary precipitation and colloidal processes in regulating arsenic fate and transport. The findings advance mechanistic understanding of spatial variability in arsenic contamination and provide insights relevant to groundwater management in affected regions.
