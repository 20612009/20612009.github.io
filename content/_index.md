      text: |
        My current research focuses on redox-driven geochemical transformations, sediment–water interactions, and coupled surface–groundwater processes influencing mobilization and speciation of arsenic in groundwater systems. This work involves rigorous field-based spatial and temporal hydrogeochemical surveys, laboratory experimentation, multivariate statistical analyses, and geochemical modeling tools.
